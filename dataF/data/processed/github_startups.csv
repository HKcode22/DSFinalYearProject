"FlightCar is the first company to establish a marketplace that allows vehicle owners parking at the airport to rent out their cars to other travelers. Owners get free airport parking, and renters choose from a wider selection of vehicles at lower prices than those offered by the major car rental chains. A similar peer-to-peer car sharing model successfully exists at a local level, where owners rent out their vehicles to neighbors.

"Like most good ideas, it began with a frustration over the status quo. Networks were too complex, too costly and too inefficient.Dave’s eureka moment came when reading Microsoft’s paper on traffic patterns, understanding that network congestion was a result of inefficient conversations taking place within its infrastructure. So, he created an SDN controller to understand and direct these conversations. However, Dave soon realized that the dynamic software could only work with underlying hardware that would also change on the fly. Thus, the Plexxi Switch was born, using photonic switching technologies to bring an adaptable capacity to a previously static environment.",,Plexxi,,,Rethinking the network.,,,"$8,300,000","Feb 15, 2011","$20,000,000","Jul 28, 2011","$20,100,000","Jun 29, 2012",,,,GitHub_funding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pley rents products that families need for a short time (as kids grow), it reduces costs by 70%, eliminates clutter and, reduces waste as products get reused.  A key competitive advantage the company has is the proprietary machines that process rental items in scale - designed internally by the former COO of Netflix.
